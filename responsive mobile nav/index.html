                    nefarious SQL statement are inserted into an entry field for execution. Sql injection must 
                    exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example when user input 
                    is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed.Sql injection is mostly known as an attack
                    vector for website but can be used to attack any type of sql injection.<br><br><b>Types of
                    Sql injection.</b>
